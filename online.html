            <div class="tussentitel"><h2 id="nummer1"> #1 Roblox </h2>
                <p><a href="https://www.roblox.com/GAMES/?SortFilter=default&TimeFilter=0"><img class="zweefLinks" src="afbeeldingen/roblocks.jpg"></a> people know about Roblox, because it's an incredibly popular gaming site. There is an almost endless ammount of games to play, some better than others, from Hide & seek to Granny, it's all available on here. You can play alone or with friends, but I would recommend playing with your friends, beacuse playing most games together makes it way more fun! There are tons of different games, some take a long time to play and some ae very short and simple and some are endless. Some of my personal favorite games to play are; Hide & seek, Restaurant Tycoon and Jail Break. <br> Click on the image to visit the website!</p>

            <div class="tussentitel"><h2 id="nummer2">#2 Minecraft </h2>
                <p><a href="https://play.euw.leagueoflegends.com/en_GB"><img class="zweefRechts" src="afbeeldingen/minecraft.png"></a>This game is a lot harder than most online games, it requires a ton of time and effort but it's a really cool game and I would definetely recommend atleast checking it out once. The game essentially exist of a round where two teams play against eachother and you play with a character of choice, the more you play, the better you'll get and the more characters you'll get to choose from! These characters all have different abilities and recquire a differnt control, which is why this game never gets boring. This game is in fact so popular that there are tournaments where people from all over the world play against eachother and see who's best. <br> Click on the image to visit the website!</p>
