            <p>Choices matter games are games where your choices matter, so there are certain scenes where you'll be having a conversation, for example, and you'll get a few options for what to say. What you decide to say can change the stoyline of the game, but that can mean different things in some situations it means your relationship with others will change but sometimes it means your whole gameplay will change or it can be both!</p>
